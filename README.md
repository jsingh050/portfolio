## Welcome to my portfolio. 
# Please check out the projects I have worked on using Matlab, C++, and Python. I appreciate your patience as I reorganize and transfer in files from external sources to this github portfolio. If you are interested in a particular project and have questions, email me at JAS627@pitt.edu


# MATLAB PROJECTS
1. Computer Vision 
2. BCI Decoder
3. 


# PYTHON PROJECTS 
1. 1-d cochlea
2. Keyword Spotting Using Spiking Neural Networks
3. Image Classification using ANN on MNIST dataset
4. Motion Detection Camera: Using Python's CV2 and numpy, I created a Neuromorphic DVS camera which detects movement and motion.
5. Instantiating different bio-inspired neuron models such as the leaky-integrate and fire, hodgkin-huxley. 



# If you are interested in additional coursework projects I have done related to neural enigneering or data science, please view my other repositories.
